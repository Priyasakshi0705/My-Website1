                    My hobby is coding as it gives me the freedom to create whatever I want on the computer. So far I have got to learn to use the 3 languages known as (Html,Js and Css).I have also learnt to make games. And I have also learnt to use different platforms. All this was possible because of my teacher who teaches me coading through WhiteHat Jr.
